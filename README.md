## Website Description

ListingLogix is a modern platform built for real estate professionals and agencies to showcase, manage, and browse property listings with ease. Whether you're promoting a multi-million dollar mansion or a cozy studio, ListingLogix ensures your listings look polished and professional.

Users can create detailed property listings with descriptions, pricing, and location—and upload multiple high-quality photos to each one. Listing pages are visually clean, responsive, and mobile-ready. Profiles for each agent help personalize the platform, encouraging transparency and trust.

This app blends backend functionality with front-end finesse, giving agents the power to manage their inventory and put their best listings forward — with photos that always look clean, consistent, and scrollable.
